About me
========

I'm a programmer mostly interested in web development, open standards and
information security.

I'm an occasional maintainer of `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ and all of
its dependencies (`Click <http://click.pocoo.org/>`_ and `Werkzeug
<http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/>`_) and probably known mostly because of that.

The biggest project I've started is `vdirsyncer
<https://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/>`_, part of a set of CLI tools for contact-,
calendar- and task-management called `pimutils <https://pimutils.org/>`_. Even
without the other tools it can be used as a backup and export tool for
calendars and contacts from various sources.

All the projects mentioned above are written in Python, but I've started to
work with `Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/>`_ a bit too. You can find most of
my opensource work on `GitHub <https://github.com/untitaker/>`_.

Currently I'm busy with my CS bachelor at `TU Wien
<https://www.tuwien.ac.at/>`_.
