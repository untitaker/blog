Contact
=======

- `GitHub <https://github.com/untitaker>`_

  If it is about one of my projects, opening an issue instead is the best way
  to contact me.

- `markus@unterwaditzer.net <markus@unterwaditzer.net>`_

  This is the most reliable way to get in contact with me.

  GPG fingerprint: ``C3A0 3AD4 B099 44F4 204A  5F88 31E9 EFF9 FAAC 788C``
  Download the key from `MIT
  <https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x31E9EFF9FAAC788C>`_ or `my
  server </markus.asc>`_.

  **Please don't send me GPG-encrypted email** unless you're literally being
  chased by secret services (and preferrably not even then). GPG is absolutely
  dreadful to deal with on every level, and if I didn't have to sign something
  once every decade I'd rather not have any GPG key at all.

- `Twitter <https://twitter.com/untitaker>`_, `Mastodon <https://mastodon.social/@untitaker>`_

  Neither are suitable for constructive or complex discussions, yet
  discussions still happen there. Anyway, follow me there.

- My nickname is ``untitaker`` on IRC and most other services, but I may not
  respond at all.
