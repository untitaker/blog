GPG fingerprint: `C3A0 3AD4 B099 44F4 204A  5F88 31E9 EFF9 FAAC 788C`

Download the key from
[MIT](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x31E9EFF9FAAC788C)
or [my server](/markus.asc).

**Please don't send me GPG-encrypted email**. GPG is
absolutely dreadful to deal with on every level, and if I
didn\'t have to sign something once every decade I\'d
rather not have any GPG key at all.
